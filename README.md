UCLA: GEOG XL7 Final Project

In the wake of the 2015 Aliso Canyon methane gas leak

 in Porter Ranch (a neighborhood of Los Angeles in the northern San Fernando Valley), the State of California wants to assess the potential threats posed by oil and gas extraction sites to schools throughout Los Angeles County. In particular, policymakers need information about the current state of petroleum and gas extraction in Los Angeles County, and also need additional information about what factors must be considered to revise and update existing protocols regarding the identification of potentially at-risk school locations.  
Specifically, you are responsible for preparing a brief report that includes at least the following elements:
A map showing the distribution of oil and gas wells within Los Angeles County;
Maps showing (1) buffer areas around oil and gas wells, and (2) public school locations, with one map for each of the following buffer distances (hint:  in order to keep the map as clean as possible, you may wish to use a dissolved buffer area and remove oil/gas well points): 
1,000 feet;
1/2 mile;
1 mile;
For each of the aforementioned buffer distances individually, a table or infographic displaying the number and percentage of all schools that fall within the specified buffer distance surrounding oil/gas wells;
For each of the aforementioned buffer distances individually, a table or infographic displaying the number and percentage of oil/gas wells that fall within the specified buffer distance surrounding schools;
A list of schools, grouped by school district, that lie within one mile of a well where hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") is used for extracting oil and gas.  (hint: find wells with value of "HydFrac" equal to 'Y') 
A short written discussion of your GIS methodology (i.e., a description what techniques and processes you used) and an assessment of the proximity-based hazards that oil and gas wells could possibly impose upon students at public schools in Los Angeles County.
Submission of the above components (assuming all are completed accurately and correctly) will be sufficient to earn 80% of the available points for this assignment.  To earn the remaining 20%, your report must extend beyond and/or improve upon the minimum requirements.   Extending beyond the minimum requirements can include (but is not limited to) the following:
Designing and developing extra map(s)/visualization(s) that contribute to the usefulness of the report;
Disaggregating schools by type (elementary, high school, etc.) and incorporating this into your analysis;
Making greater use of some of the many attributes included with the oil and gas wells data layer (codebook explaining field values can be found here
 (Links to an external site.)
);
Incorporating demographic data or other potentially relevant data layers in the spatial analysis operations.
All maps should be aesthetically appealing and include all commonly required map elements and components as described so far in the course, and the report overall should be professionally presented with a focus upon readability.  Your work will be evaluated holistically based on the overall quality of your work, the clarity and aesthetic characteristics of the report and any included maps and visualizations, and the extent to which you went above and beyond the minimum requirements.
